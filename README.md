# Hi there, I'm Ahoa ðŸ‘‹

I am an accountant with a keen interest in tech and enjoys problem solving.
I'm hoping to pivot into a career within software development so I can spend my days working with code and honing my skills and knowledge.

I'm currently enrolled on Founders and Coders part-time programme and am really enjoying the peer led approach to learning.

Things I am currently working on:

- Javascript practice
- Founders and Coders agency project
- Learning git workflow
- Accessibility
- More Javascript practice!!
