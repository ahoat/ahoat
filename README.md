# Hi there, I'm Ahoa ðŸ‘‹

I am an accountant with a keen interest in tech and enjoys problem solving.
While I know my way around a spreadsheet, I'm hoping to pivot into a career within software development so I can spend my days working with code and honing my skills and knowledge.

I'm currently enrolled on [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) part-time programme and am really enjoying the peer led approach to learning.
So far, I am learning HTML, CSS and Javascript but there's a long list of technologies, languages and frameworks I want to pick up.  In no particular order:
- Typescript
- React
- SQL
- Node.js
- Python
- Vue.js
